            It is an amazing place, although expensive, for star wars fans to have a good time. <b>Snarky storm troopers</b> walk the streets and take to guard posts on buildings. They bother individuals dressed as jedi or other threats to the empire.
            Your movie heroes walk about for you to meet. You can construct your very own droid or even better yet, your own <b>lightsaber</b>.
